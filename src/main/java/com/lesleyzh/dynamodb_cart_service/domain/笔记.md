@DynamoDbBean: Marks this Java class (Cart) as a DynamoDB item (a single row in the table), AWS DynamoDB Enhanced Client uses this to map Java objects to DynamoDB items.

@DynamoDbPartitionKey: Marks cartId as the Partition Key (also called the Primary Key).
The Partition Key uniquely identifies each item in the DynamoDB table.

@DynamoDbAttribute("cartId"): Maps a Java field to a DynamoDB column (if names differ).


You have only one DynamoDB table (e.g., cart-table) where each item (row) represents a shopping cart. The Cart contains a list of CartItem objects, but CartItem does not have its own separate table.
This is an embedded data model commonly used in NoSQL databases like DynamoDB. It's a good choice when you have a one-to-many relationship between two entities and the child entity (CartItem) is always accessed through the parent entity (Cart).

Example item in cart-table:
{
"cartId": "cart123",
"userId": "userA",
"items": [
    {
    "productId": "p1",
    "quantity": 2,
    "productName": "Laptop",
    "price": 999.99
    },
    {
    "productId": "p2",
    "quantity": 1,
    "productName": "Mouse",
    "price": 49.99
    }],
"createdAt": 1707833200,
"updatedAt": 1707840000
}
